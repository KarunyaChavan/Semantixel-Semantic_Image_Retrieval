# Introduction

Semantixel is a semantic image retrieval system that enables searching and exploring large image collections using natural language and visual queries. It addresses the challenge of finding images by meaning rather than by exact filenames or manually assigned tags, leveraging modern deep learning techniques to map images and text into a shared vector space.

The project uses deep learning models (notably CLIP-style encoders) to compute dense embeddings for images and text, then performs similarity search over those embeddings to retrieve semantically relevant images. Semantixel is aimed at use cases such as visual search, digital asset management, content recommendation, and interactive exploration of photo collections.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The repository contains modules for creating and managing an embedding index, extracting features with CLIP-compatible encoders, a small web UI for querying results, and utilities for preprocessing and storing embeddings.
